### Import/Dependency Errors
| Service | Error Type | Module | Details |
|---------|------------|--------|---------|
| All | ImportError | `main` module | Tests try to import from `main` but may fail if module path is incorrect |
| All | ImportError | External dependencies | May fail if dependencies not properly mocked |
| All | MongoDB connection | `pymongo` | Tests use mocked DB but real imports may cause issues |

### Test Execution Errors
| Test Run | Service | Error | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2025-09-17 13:30 | core-orchestrator | No tests collected (empty file) | ❌ Failed |
| 2025-09-17 13:30 | job-search | Not executed yet | ⏳ Pending |
| 2025-09-17 13:30 | resume-upload | Not executed yet | ⏳ Pending |

## Code Issues Found

### 1. Missing Test Files
**Issue**: Two test files are completely empty
- `docker/core-orchestrator/test_main.py`
- `docker/streamlit-ui/test_main.py`

**Impact**: Cannot run tests for these services
**Priority**: High
**Fix Required**: Recreate these test files

### 2. Import Path Issues
**Issue**: Test files import from `main` module which may not be in Python path
**Example**: `from main import app, MCPToolResponse, ...`
**Impact**: ImportError when running tests
**Priority**: Medium
**Fix Required**: Adjust import paths or ensure proper module structure

### 3. Mocking Complexity
**Issue**: Complex mocking required for external dependencies
**Examples**:
- MongoDB operations
- External API calls
- File I/O operations
- ML library functions

**Impact**: Tests may fail if mocking is incomplete
**Priority**: Medium
**Fix Required**: Ensure comprehensive mocking setup

## Resolution Plan

### Phase 1: Recreate Missing Test Files
1. Recreate `docker/core-orchestrator/test_main.py`
2. Recreate `docker/streamlit-ui/test_main.py`

### Phase 2: Fix Import Issues
1. Verify import paths are correct
2. Ensure test files can import required modules
3. Add proper Python path configuration if needed

### Phase 3: Execute Tests
1. Run tests for each service individually
2. Document any new errors found
3. Fix issues iteratively

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Verify mocking is comprehensive
3. Confirm error handling works correctly

## Test Execution Results

### Service: core-orchestrator
**Status**: ❌ Cannot execute (empty file)
**Error**: pytest collected 0 items
**Next Action**: Recreate test file

### Service: job-search
**Status**: ⏳ Not executed yet
**Next Action**: Run tests after fixing import issues

### Service: resume-upload
**Status**: ⏳ Not executed yet
**Next Action**: Run tests after fixing import issues

## Notes
- All test files were created with comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
- Testing dependencies (pytest, mongomock, etc.) have been installed
- Disk space was cleaned up (~230MB freed)
- The core business logic appears to be working correctly based on file analysis
